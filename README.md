## Testing my svg-knob lib with React

    create-react-app lab-svg-knob
       
    yarn start
      Starts the development server.
    
    yarn build
      Bundles the app into static files for production.
    
    yarn test
      Starts the test runner.
    
    yarn eject
      Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
      and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
       

    cd lab-svg-knob
    yarn start
