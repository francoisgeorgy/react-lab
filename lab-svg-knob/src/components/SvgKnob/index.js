    // This method is called when your component is being created and before mounting (being added to the DOM).

        //     clicks: 0
        // };

    }

    // Your component has now been rendered and exists in the DOM. This is the point when you should initiate
    // AJAX requests, add event listeners, and perform any set up that requires a DOM.
    // Calling setState during this method or any time after will cause a re-render.

        this.k = new Knob('#knob', { /* config... */ });

        //     // Event.target: a reference to the object that dispatched the event. It is different from event.currentTarget
        //     //               when the event handler is called during the bubbling or capturing phase of the event.

    // componentWillReceiveProps
    // When your component receives new props from its parent, componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) is triggered.
    // This is a great time to check if there are changes in the incoming props when compared to your current props
    // and trigger a state change based on the new values. A common use-case for this is resetting state based on a change.

    // componentDidUpdate
    // Immediately after React builds you a shiny new UI, componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) is invoked.
    // This is a great time to interact with the DOM or instantiate a new network request based on what the new
    // interface should look like.
